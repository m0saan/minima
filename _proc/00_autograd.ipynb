    "Today, I'd like to introduce you to the automatic differentiation component of my deep learning framework, Minima. I am going to explain a specific module, called Micrograd, in detail. I had released the Micrograd module on Github a couple of years ago, but never provided an in-depth explanation of its functioning. So here we go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Micrograd, at its core, is an autograd (short for automatic gradient) engine. It implements the backpropagation algorithm, a crucial aspect of deep learning. Backpropagation enables efficient computation of the gradient (rate of change) of a loss function (something we aim to minimize) with respect to the weights of a neural network. This enables us to fine-tune the weights of the neural network iteratively, reducing the loss function, and in turn, increasing the accuracy of the network. Backpropagation is central to most modern deep neural network libraries, such as PyTorch or Jax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help illustrate what Micrograd does, consider a simple example. We start with two inputs, a and b, encapsulated in special objects we call \"Value\" objects. We then construct a mathematical expression involving a and b. The Value objects help Micrograd to keep track of how these inputs are being transformed, and the operations performed on them, resulting in a complete mathematical \"expression graph\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Micrograd then performs two key tasks. First, it carries out a 'forward pass' - it evaluates the final value of the expression we've created. But more importantly, it then performs a 'backward pass' - essentially a run of the backpropagation algorithm. It starts from the final value and traces back through the expression graph, calculating the derivative (rate of change) of the final value with respect to each of the original inputs and intermediate nodes, using the chain rule of calculus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial as these derivatives tell us how much our final value is affected by small changes in the inputs. In essence, the derivative of the final value with respect to an input is a measure of the \"sensitivity\" of the final value to that input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the example above might seem abstract - the expression we constructed didn't have any particular meaning, it was just a demonstration of the capabilities of Micrograd. But the reason it's useful is that this kind of mathematical expression is exactly what neural networks are - they take input data and network weights as inputs, and transform them through a series of mathematical operations into a final output, usually a prediction or a loss value.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to note here is that Micrograd operates at the level of individual scalar values, not n-dimensional tensors as you'd typically find in full-scale deep learning libraries. This is for simplicity and instructional clarity. In real-world, high-performance neural network libraries, tensors are used to bundle up large arrays of scalar values, enabling efficient, parallel computation. But fundamentally, the math stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what's the magic behind Micrograd? Surprisingly, the core autograd engine, the part that handles backpropagation and makes neural network training possible, is a mere 100 lines of simple Python code. On top of that, the neural network library, constructed based on this autograd engine, is only an additional 50 lines of code. It's pretty impressive how much power you can get from just a handful of well-written Python code lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is to say, understanding automatic differentiation and neural network training doesn't require an enormous, complicated codebase. It's essentially about understanding a relatively small number of key concepts and how they work together. Of course, making these things run fast and efficiently in practice does require additional complexity, but at a fundamental level, what's happening isn't that complicated. And Micrograd serves as an excellent tool for understanding these fundamentals. Now,"

    "Automatic differentiation, or auto grad as it's often referred to in the context of deep learning, is a powerful tool that greatly simplifies the process of working with derivatives. It does this by automatically computing the derivatives (or gradients) of functions, thus relieving the need to manually calculate these derivatives as we have done above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of auto grad is fundamental to the training process of deep learning models. Deep learning models, such as neural networks, are essentially complex mathematical functions with many parameters (weights and biases). Training these models involves adjusting these parameters to minimize a loss function, which quantifies how well the model is performing on a given task. The most common method for doing this is gradient descent, which uses the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters to update the parameters in a way that decreases the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the manual calculation of these gradients, especially for complex models, is not only tedious but also prone to errors. Here's where auto grad comes in. By using automatic differentiation, we can compute these gradients automatically and accurately, no matter how complex the model is.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a deep learning framework, when we define our model and loss function, the framework uses auto grad to build a computational graph under the hood. This graph captures all the computations that are done in the forward pass (i.e., when we pass our inputs through the model to get the output). Then, when we need to compute the gradients during the backward pass, the framework uses this computational graph and the chain rule from calculus to compute the gradients automatically. This process is often referred to as backpropagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantage of using auto grad in deep learning is that it allows us to focus on designing our models and defining our loss functions without worrying about the details of computing the gradients. This simplifies our code, reduces the chance of errors, and allows for greater flexibility in designing complex models. In fact, with auto grad, we can easily experiment with new types of models and loss functions, as we can rely on the framework to correctly compute the gradients no matter how complex our design is."
