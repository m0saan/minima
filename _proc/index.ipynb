    "> minima is a lightweight deep learning framewor, lean yet effective tailor-made for educational exploration.   \n",
    "Just like a delicate sapling inspired by the towering strength of an oak, Minima draws its inspiration from PyTorch.  \n",
    "Yet, it carves its own identity with a straightforward interface and a curated set of features.   \n",
    "This makes learning and using it a breeze, allowing you to effortlessly build and train neural networks.   \n",
    "Indeed, Minima is your friendly companion on the journey to understanding deep learning, where less is often more."

    "# Train the model\n",
