    "Sure! Here's a sample README for your mini deep learning framework called \"minima\":\n",
    "\n",
    "# Minima: A Mini Deep Learning Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Minima is a lightweight deep learning framework designed to make it easy to build and train neural networks. It is inspired by PyTorch, but has a simpler interface and fewer features, making it easier to learn and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy to install and use\n",
    "- Simple and intuitive API for defining and training neural networks\n",
    "- Built-in support for common layers and activation functions\n",
    "- Supports both CPU and GPU acceleration\n",
    "- Compatible with NumPy arrays for easy data manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Minima, simply clone the repository and run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will install the package and all its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of how to define and train a neural network using Minima:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import minima\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define the neural network architecture\n",
    "model = minima.Sequential(\n",
    "    minima.Linear(784, 128),\n",
    "    minima.ReLU(),\n",
    "    minima.Linear(128, 10),\n",
    "    minima.Softmax()\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Load the dataset\n",
    "x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test = load_data()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Train the model\n",
    "loss_fn = minima.CrossEntropyLoss()\n",
    "optimizer = minima.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n",
    "for epoch in range(10):\n",
    "    for x_batch, y_batch in minibatch(x_train, y_train, batch_size=32):\n",
    "        y_pred = model(x_batch)\n",
    "        loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_batch)\n",
    "        optimizer.zero_grad()\n",
    "        loss.backward()\n",
    "        optimizer.step()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluate the model\n",
    "y_pred = model(x_test)\n",
    "accuracy = compute_accuracy(y_pred, y_test)\n",
    "print(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This example defines a simple neural network with two linear layers and two activation functions, trains it on a dataset using stochastic gradient descent, and evaluates its accuracy on a test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to use Minima, please refer to the documentation, which can be found in the `docs/` directory of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
