    "Now, if we consider a Python class `Transpose` that implements this transposition operation, we would have a `gradient` method in the class that computes the derivative of the transpose operation. This method would apply the transpose function to `out_grad`, which represents the gradient of the output tensor, thereby giving us the transposed gradient of the original tensor. In the code, `transpose(out_grad, axes=self.axes)` performs the transposition of `out_grad` along the same axes that were used in the forward pass. Thus, the gradient of the transposition operation with respect to the input tensor `a` is computed as the transpose of the output gradient `out_grad`."

    "The `Summation` operation, when provided with the `axes` argument, sums over these axes and thereby reduces the rank of the tensor by the number of axes summed over. The backward pass needs to take this into account, as it needs to return a gradient tensor of the same shape as the input.\n",

Since every element of the input tensor contributes equally to the sum, the derivative of the sum with respect to each element is 1.
