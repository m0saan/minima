    "> The `init` module in the `minima` (mi) library provides a suite of tensor initialization functions to create and initialize tensors in various ways. Each function in this module represents a different strategy for initializing the values of a tensor, such as uniform or normal random values, constant values, or specialized initializations like Xavier or Kaiming methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These initialization methods serve as the starting point for the optimization process in neural networks, setting the stage for gradient descent and other optimization methods to fine-tune the model's parameters during training. Carefully chosen initial values can significantly influence the training dynamics and the final performance of a model.\n",
    "The `init` module is a critical part of the deep learning pipeline, providing the essential first step in the process of training a neural network. It ensures a smooth and effective transition from model definition to the iterative process of learning from data."
