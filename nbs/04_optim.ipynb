    "> The `Optim` module in minima is a flexible and powerful toolbox for optimizing the parameters of your deep learning models. Built on a high-level,  \n",
    "> intuitive, and pythonic API, it provides several out-of-the-box optimization strategies, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and more.  \n",
    "> In the heart of this module lies the abstract `Optimizer` class that defines a standard interface for all the optimization strategies.  \n",
    "> Each specific optimizer class implements this interface, which ensures a consistent usage and allows for easy swapping of different strategies in your training loop.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Among the features of this module are:  \n",
    "> - Efficient gradient computations and updates.  \n",
    "> - Advanced optimization strategies with adaptive learning rates.  \n",
    "> - Easy to extend to custom optimization strategies.  \n",
    "> - Supports weight decay regularization for avoiding overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Whether you're training a simple linear regression or a complex deep neural network, `Optim` has got you covered. With its simple and consistent interface, the module makes the task of optimizing your models a breeze.\n"

    "  \n",
    "Imagine you're trying to navigate your way across a complex terrain - like a big mountain with lots of hills, valleys and flat areas.   \n",
    "Your goal is to find the lowest valley. This is much like the problem a neural network faces when it's trying to find the optimal values for its weights - the lowest point in its loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start at a random point on this terrain, which is like initializing your model with random weights. Now, you need to figure out which direction to go in to get to the lowest point.    \n",
    "You can't see the whole terrain at once, but you can look around your current location and see which way is downhill. This is like calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In a basic gradient descent algorithm, you would just go in the direction of the steepest slope with a fixed step size. But this approach can lead to problems.    \n",
    "What if you're on a steep slope and you take too big of a step? You might overshoot the valley you're trying to get to. Or, what if you're on a flat part of the   \n",
    "terrain and you take too small of a step? You might get stuck and not make much progress.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is where AdaGrad comes in. AdaGrad is like a smart hiker that adjusts its step size based on the terrain it's currently on.   \n",
    "If it's on a steep slope, it takes smaller steps to avoid overshooting the valley. If it's on a flat area, it takes bigger steps to make faster progress. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does this by keeping track of the sum of the squares of the gradients that it has seen so far (kinda like a memory), and uses this to scale down the step size.   \n",
    "This means that parameters with larger gradients will have their learning rate decreased more, while parameters with smaller gradients will have their learning rate   \n",
    "\n",
    "The neat thing about AdaGrad is that it adjusts the learning rate for each parameter individually, based on what it's learned about the landscape around that parameter.   \n",
    "This can be especially useful when dealing with sparse data, where only a few parameters might be updated frequently."

    "> **Detailed explanation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the foundational concepts of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), we have AdaGrad, an algorithm that introduces an innovative twist to the optimization process.  \n",
    "Unlike traditional SGD that utilizes a single learning rate $\\alpha$ across all parameters, AdaGrad institutes a per-parameter learning rate. The learning rate for AdaGrad is computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta_{t} = \\theta_{t-1} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\sqrt{G_t + \\epsilon}} \\cdot g_{t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\theta_{t}$ represents the model parameters at time step $t$, $\\alpha$ is the initial learning rate, $g_{t}$ is the gradient at time step $t$, $G_{t}$ is a diagonal matrix   \n",
    "where each diagonal element $i, i$ is the sum of the squares of the gradients w.r.t. $\\theta_i$ up to time step $t$, and $\\epsilon$ is a smoothing term to avoid division by zero (usually on the order of $1e-7$).\n",
    "\n",
    "In AdaGrad, each parameter $\\theta_i$ gets its own learning rate, which is inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of the squares of past gradients.  \n",
    "This is the `cache` in the implementation, which holds a history of squared gradients. The greater the sum of the past gradients for a particular parameter, the smaller the learning rate for that parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature allows AdaGrad to normalize the updates made during training, preventing any single weight from rising too high compared to the others.  \n",
    "This is particularly beneficial when dealing with sparse data, as the less frequently updated parameters are allowed larger updates when they do get updated, thereby effectively utilizing more neurons for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to note that AdaGrad has a tendency to decrease the learning rate quite aggressively due to the constant accumulation of the square of gradients in $G_{t}$.   \n",
    "This can sometimes lead to premature and excessive decay of the learning rate during training, causing the model to stop learning before reaching the optimal point.   \n",
    "This monotonic decrease in the learning rate is one reason AdaGrad is not as widely used, except in some specific applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, AdaGrad adds a valuable tool to our optimization toolkit by providing an adaptive learning rate for each individual parameter.  \n",
    "It elegantly solves the problem of learning rate selection and normalization of parameter updates, and while it has some limitations, it's a   \n",
    "powerful concept that has paved the way for further innovations in optimization algorithms."
